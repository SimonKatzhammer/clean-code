# Clean Code Exercises

Personal exercises and code trials while working through "Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship" (Second Edition) by Robert C. Martin.

## Structure

The book is organized into 4 parts:

- **Code**: Clean code principles and practices
- **Design**: Design patterns and principles
- **Architecture**: System architecture and structure
- **Craftsmanship**: Professional software craftsmanship

Each part has its own directory for code examples, exercises, and notes.
